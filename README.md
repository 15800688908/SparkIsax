# SparkIsax
the fastest distributed algorithm for building the timeseries index

following are  a brief installation guide.  I will provide my papers in another url the next time with algorithm description and replace this with a detailed installation instructions. My main idea is included in sparkindex/sparkIndex.scalaã€‚
## prerequisite


1.copy spark libs and hbase libs into libs

2.intellij with scala plugin

3.scala 10.4+

4.Java1.7 +

5.package the project into a jar(named SparkIsax.jar)

because of the size limit on the github, i didn't push my libs and jars.

## Usage
spark-submit --master spark://master:7077 SparkIsax.jar  tableName  inputPath MaximumDepth
